#subset suppliers
#merge by major suppliers
#From a previous exploration, we saw that the R2 improves when we build the linear regression model to correspond to a given supplier.  But we must be careful not to overfit. From the data we see that there are XX major suppliers.  Let us match a linear model to these suppliers and then make an average model for the other suppliers.

table(mergetubetrain$supplier)

#We see that Suppliers 66, 41, 72 are the top three suppliers, accounting for just over 85% of the data with (S-66 accounting for 68%, S-41 accounting for 11%, and S-72 accounting for 7.6% of the data.) 
#Thus we will create individual linear regression models for these "major suppliers."
#For the other suppliers, we will allow these tube costs to be predicted by a general linear regression model. This group of "non-major suppliers" accounts for 4020 records (or just under 15% of the data)
#Note for Caesar, Sunita did this analysis in Excel.

#this results in an RMSE of 0.4 (for log.cost), which is 1.49 for cost.  (i.e.$1.49)  This could be considered pretty high given that some tubes are only $2.50 (when bought in bulk)

#I did similar calculations for S-041 and S-72.  I found R2 of 45% and 29% respectively.  On this basis, I decided not to further segment the data.
#Instead, I think we will be better off making a general model for non-S-066 suppliers.  See below!

# Caterpillar-tube-pricing-strategy1
A Kaggle competion on Pricing strategy for the Caterpillar Corporation

The purpose of this competition is to help Caterpillar (you know, the behemoth construction company) to better predict prices of tubes.  It purchases thousands of different tubes from thousands of suppliers around the world.  Both the make-up and size of the tubes vary, as does the quantity in which they are ordered.

My write up is included in the code itself.  

This competition showed my strong data exploration and manipulation skills (including feature engineering).  It also showed my analytical skills (in testing various linear regression models and assessing the results using RMSE with a test set).  It showed my ability to manipulate the large dataset (as I had to merge several files in order to obtain the appropriate set of indicators for analysis).  Finally, it showed my ability to group data and develop specific regression models per subset of data.
